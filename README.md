# EEG_classification

This is a convolutional neural network (CNN) model tailored for EEG classification using the DEAP dataset, achieving an impressive 91% accuracy on the test dataset. EEG signals from all participants are aggregated for model training, employing an 80-20 train-test split. The model comprises five convolutional layers, gradually increasing from 32 to 128 channels and then reducing to 16 channels. Following the convolutional layers, a feedforward layer is incorporated for further processing.
